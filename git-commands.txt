To initialize as a git repository - on the bash shell you will type: (make sure you are in the directory you want to make a repository)

	git init

To get the status of a particular repository: (tells us information about what needs to be done on the repo, keeps track of current state of the repo)

	git status

When files are added to a repository you can add them as committed using: (this adds the files to the staging area to be included in the next commit)

	git add <filename>
	git add .		(This command adds all untracked to the staging area)

To remove the commit from the staging:

	git rm --cached <file>

Next step is to commit the project after staging the project files:

	git commit		(This will open the text editor)

	In the text editor you will want to type a message that tells what commit this is, and any message you want to add for your commit

	git commit -m "message you want to add for the commit"		(This allows for the skipping of opening the text editor for commit message)

	git commit -a -m 'message you want to add'		(this commits all the changes and submits the message instead of using add and commit)

After modifying the file and you run git status you can run this to check for what the changes are:

	git diff
	git diff --staged		(getting the difference if staged already)

Adding a branch to your git repository:

	git branch <nameofbranch>
	git checkout <nameofbranch>		(This switches you to the branch repo so you are not working in the main branch)
	git checkout -b <nameofbranch>		(This creates a new branch and immediately switches to the new branch)
	git branch	(This gives you a list of all your branches and tells you which one you are on)
	git branch --merged  (Tells you which branches have already been merged)
	git branch --no-merge	(Tells you which branches haven't been merged)
	git branch -d <nameofbranch>	(allows you to delete a branch that you no longer need)
	git branch -D <nameofbranch>	(This is a forced delete of a branch even if changes haven't been committed)

Merging branches when you have made changes that need to be committed to the main branch:

	git merge <nameofbranch>		(Remember to be in the main branch you want to move the changes to not from)
