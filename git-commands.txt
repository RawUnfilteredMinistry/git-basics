To initialize as a git repository - on the bash shell you will type: (make sure you are in the directory you want to make a repository)

	git init

To get the status of a particular repository: (tells us information about what needs to be done on the repo, keeps track of current state of the repo)

	git status

When files are added to a repository you can add them as committed using: (this adds the files to the staging area to be included in the next commit)

	git add <filename>
	git add .		(This command adds all untracted to the staging area)

To remove the commit from the staging:

	git rm --cached <file>

Next step is to commit the project after staging the project files:

	git commit		(This will open the text editor)

	In the text editor you will want to type a message that tells what commit this is, and any message you want to add for your commit

	git commit -m "message you want to add for the commit"		(This allows for the skipping of opening the text editor for commit message)

After modifying the file and you run git status you can run this to check for what the changes are:

	git diff
	git diff --staged		(getting the difference if staged already)
